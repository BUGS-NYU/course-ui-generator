# Course UI Generator
The idea of this project is to create a flexible display system which is programmed using JSON objects. The system consumes a well-formatted API, and turns that API into a course display. Instead of organizing the data in terms of courses, sections, etc., this system organizes things in terms of layout and display properties; i.e. boxes and properties on boxes.
